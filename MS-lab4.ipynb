Another researcher questions the validity of this theory or model and attempts to falsify it by showing that the sample mean they observed would be a **highly unlikely coincidence if the theory/model was true**. (This is where the p-value comes in—it measures the likelihood of observing a sample mean as extreme as the one observed if the theory/model is correct.)\n",

In this approach, you start with a null hypothesis, which you attempt to reject by measuring the extremeness of the sample statistic (as seen in the exercises presented so far, where the null hypothesis was that the population mean was 171). You don't have a decision rule. You just decide, based on domain-knowledge, if something is too extreme. Additionaly, you don't decide only after one experiment. You coduct multiple experiments before taking a decision.\n",

It follows a pre-data collection method, where you first define an alpha level (the acceptable degree of type 1 error) and also consider type 2 error. Based on the desired error rates, you calculate the minimum sample size required for the test. The testing process then becomes similar to the p-value approach, with the main difference being that, instead of computing the p-value, you compare the extremeness of the test statistic to a threshold (alpha).\n",

Most software is built using the p-value approach, as the alpha approach defaults to the p-value method when the required sample size is not computed beforehand.
